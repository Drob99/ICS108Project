# ICS108Project

#Design and implement a speed click game. In this game, a fixed number of objects will fall to your board from top and move down and leave the board. Each object will have a value. Each object will be faster than the previous object. Clicking an object removes it from the board and adds its value to the score. Keep track of the top 5 scores. As a player, click as many objects as you can.  Display the score while playing the game. When the game is over, display the top scores.
